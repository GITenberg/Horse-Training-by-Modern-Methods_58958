<h2>FOREWORD.</h2>

<p>The object of this book is to arrange in the most
convenient, clear, and concise form the modern system
of horse-training, in so far as it is applicable to the training
of horses in the mounted service of the United States.</p>

<p>No attempt has been made in any case to improve
upon methods already deemed correct by the best horsemen;
and as such methods can be found dealing with all
points of training, it follows that the subject matter in
this book is not original. Where the best was to be
found, there it has been sought, and where the authors
of previous works have expressed their ideas in language
considered the most concise and clear, their words have
been copied verbatim, with due acknowledgement to the
authors.</p>

<p>I am indebted to the following for methods, theories,
translation of technical terms, and improvised commands
herein contained:</p>

<h2>PREFACE.</h2>

<p>Nothing within this book is believed to be beyond
the reach of the mounted service in general.</p>

<p>The time allotted to “breaking” or gentling will be in
many cases eliminated, as the present system of remount
stations has become well established.</p>

<p>Each troop should have three or four such articles
as longes and cavessons. These articles can be made
very easily by saddlers and blacksmiths, from a model.
Models can undoubtedly be procured through the Mounted
Service School at Fort Riley, Kansas, or from any
saddlery store, care being taken in purchasing from the
latter to determine whether the model is a correct one
or not.</p>

<p>In many cases the reasons for the use of certain
aids, etc., are apparent, and all explanation is omitted.
In other cases, where explanations involve nice points of
mechanics, etc., they have likewise been omitted. The
reason for the latter omissions being that they are interesting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
to the student only. The real student of horse-training
can only be one who enjoys such work. Many
officers do not enjoy it, and this book is intended for all.</p>

<p>In view of the fact that all the methods embodied
herein are well-recognized methods, I trust readers will
take for granted that they conform to the mechanical
principles, etc., omitted.</p>

<p>As riding cannot be taught by books, no attempt
is made to do so here. Officers instructed in riding at
the Mounted Service School are returned to their regiments
every year, where, by their example and ability to
instruct, they can accomplish far more than any literature
on the subject; but where riding, as regards the
seat, cannot be readily forgotten, points of training a
horse can; and it is for such as forget, or for such as
have had nothing or little to forget, that this book is
intended.</p>

<p>As to riding, it might be of interest, however, to
some to note that the following cautions have been found
to be a frequent necessity while training horses with enlisted
men up:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span></p>

<p>Don’t yank upon your horse’s mouth.</p>

<p>Keep your hands low and your wrists supple.</p>

<p>Don’t stick your knees up in the air.</p>

<p>Grip with your knees and the calf of your leg.</p>

<p>Let your stirrups out (for most men).</p>

<p>Carry your legs back.</p>

<p>Don’t let your reins flop.</p>

<p>Don’t hollow out your back.</p>

<p>Don’t let your horse back up (unless the movement
is a retrograde one).</p>

<p>Drive him forward.</p>

<p>Don’t let him bend his neck at the shoulder.</p>

<p>Use your leg (or legs).</p>

<p>Don’t be rough with your horse.</p>

<p>New horses sent to a post should be turned over to
one competent officer with assistants, if necessary, for
training. If necessary to assign them to troops to assure
proper care and grooming, orders should be given that
they be exercised only by direction of the officer in
charge. Enlisted men specially suited for training horses
should be detailed under the above-named officer’s direction.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
Only such enlisted men should be detailed who
will not be discharged or detailed on other duty until
the training ceases. The training should continue for
not less than six months. Horses should, when possible,
be assigned trainers who belong to the organization to
which the horses are assigned, the rider being assured,
if possible, that the horse will be assigned to him after
the training is over.</p>

<p>Two officers can train with reasonable satisfaction
seventy-five horses, if given one hour and a half per day
six days a week, in the riding-hall. As the number of
horses in the riding-hall at a time go over fifteen the
difficulties increase.</p>

<p>In case it be impossible for new horses to be under
the direction of one officer, organization commanders
should keep the horses out of ranks an equal period, and
undertake the same training with competent men.</p>

<p>Hard-trotting, uncontrollable horses, uncomfortable
to ride and weak in muscular activity, result from lack
of training.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span></p>

<p>From practical work with enlisted men, it has been
found that there is little difficulty in teaching them the
kinds of aids, with their proper names, and the use and
form the various exercises take. The manner in which
they apply their aids and perform the exercises varies
with the individual’s ability to ride and aptitude for
training.</p>

<p>When Part II. is undertaken, the difficulties increase.
The difficulties do not lie in the use of the double rein,
which the men soon become accustomed to, but in understanding
the flexions and the delicate use of the aids
required in these exercises and in the changes of lead
at the gallop.</p>

<p>As hands are a most important element in Part II.,
it is not surprising that men who have ridden perhaps
less than three years should have difficulty.</p>

<p>Part II. should not be abandoned, either because of
the difficulties inherent to the exercises or because of the
lack of proper equipment. The use of a double bridle
improvised from a watering bridle and a regulation bit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
is preferable to the use of a single curb immediately succeeding
the work with the snaffle alone.</p>

<p>To some it may seem that confusion exists as to arrangement
of the facts. The scheme of arrangement is
as follows:</p>

<p>A man, in training a horse, can begin work on the
horse with what he finds in the beginning of this book,
and as the horse progresses he need only progress in his
reading to find new exercises. Certain definitions and
explanations are requisite to a proper understanding of
an exercise. These are necessarily interpolated.</p>

<p>If the reader will consider the difficulties in setting
forth such facts in a logical sequence, he will perhaps
be more lenient in his criticisms of this book, although
criticism is expected and sought.</p>

<h2>PART I.</h2>

<h3>CHAPTER I.<br />
<span class="smcap">Early Handling.</span></h3>

<p><i>Object of Training.</i>—Horse-training is a series of
exercises to render the horse obedient and at the same
time to preserve and develop his inherent qualities. It
is a muscular training which by suppling the parts will
strengthen the entire body, and by balancing the horse
will develop harmony in his movements.</p>

<p><i>New Horses.</i>—New horses should be exercised daily,
at first being led by men on foot, and later by men
mounted on quiet horses. The exercise should be at a
walk, and is used to quiet and strengthen the animals.
When leading a young horse mounted, the side upon
which he is led should often be changed to avoid giving
a false set to the neck.</p>

<p><i>Care of New Horses.</i>—The young horse should have
flannel bandages on his fore legs when exercised, from
the fetlock to the knee, to support the flexor tendons and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
to keep the horse from hitting himself, thereby often
causing splints.</p>

<p>After exercising, the legs should be rubbed and the
tendons massaged, then washed with cool water and flannel
bandages applied. The tendons are thereby supported
and wind-puffs and swellings prevented.</p>

<p><i>How to Adjust a Bandage.</i>—A bandage should be
wound up with the tapes inside. Unroll six or eight inches
of it, and lay this loose portion obliquely across the
outside of the leg, close to the knee, with the end reaching
to about the center of that joint, and the rolled-up
part turned to the outside, and directed downward and
forward. The beginning should be continued around
the fetlock and upper part of the pastern, and brought
back close up below the knee. The loose end is then
turned down, and the folds of the bandage carried over
it. The tapes are tied a little above the center of the
cannon bone. (<i>Hayes.</i>)</p>

<p><i>To Approach an Uncertain Horse.</i>—To go up to
an uncertain horse which is held or tied up in the
open, approach the fore leg on the near side at an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
angle of about 70 degrees to the direction of the axis of
the horse. Having reached his shoulder, place a hand
on his crest and stroke the mane. When a certain degree
of confidence is restored to the horse, further handling
may be undertaken.</p>

<p><i>To Lead a Horse with the Snaffle, and to Adjust
Snaffle.</i>—To lead a horse with a snaffle mounted or dismounted,
pass both reins through the near snaffle ring
if the horse is to be on the off side. In placing the snaffle
bridle upon a fractious horse, place the reins first over
the neck, if possible. If the horse objects to having
the head-stall put on, unfasten the left check-strap from
the ring of the snaffle. Place the head-stall in position,
then put the bit in the mouth and refasten the cheek-strap.
If impracticable to remove the halter before
bridling the horse, place the bridle on over the halter,
then unfasten the halter, slip the nose-band down over
the nostrils, then into the mouth and around under the
bit and out of the mouth. The halter will then fall off.</p>

<p><i>Longeing.</i>—The following principles must be considered
when longeing:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span></p>

<p>1. The horse must be controlled by the longe; the
only function of the whip is to move the horse forward.</p>

<p>2. The length of the longe should be frequently
changed. The horse should alternately stretch himself
on a large circle and bend himself on a small circle.</p>

<p>3. The gaits should frequently be changed. (<i>Notes
d’Equitation.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Method of Longeing a Horse.</i>—Start the longeing
exercise without the longeing whip. Place the
cavesson on the horse, if possible, after the halter has
been removed, or, if a bridle is on the horse, over the
bridle. Fasten the longe into the ring of the cavesson.
Face the same way the horse faces and walk near his
head, leading him by a short longe in a circle to the left;
right hand on the longe near the horse’s head, longe in
the left hand, not coiled, but arranged so that in running
out quickly it will not become entangled or pinch the
fingers.</p>

<p>If the horse refuses to lead, an assistant may urge
him forward as quietly as possible from the rear. As
the horse becomes accustomed to being led, gradually<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
lengthen the longe and drop back slightly from the head
of the horse, toward his shoulders. Cluck to the horse
to urge him forward. Use the hand to make motions
for the same purpose or tap him lightly with the hand
on his side, in case the horse refuses to go forward. If
the horse turns toward the trainer, shake the longe so
that it lightly taps the nose on the side of the horse
which should be toward the center of the circle. Gradually,
as the horse learns what is wanted, the trainer
moves so that the horse circles about him, first at a slow
gait, then at the trot, and finally, when more proficient,
at the canter and gallop.</p>

<p>To slow down the gait, use the voice soothingly and
shake the longe up and down gently. To stop the horse,
a series of motions of the longe up and down, with a
strong pull on the longe as it comes down, will have the
greatest effect. The word “whoa” should frequently
be used in this movement. When the horse obeys, he
should be caressed.</p>

<p>When a horse will go to the left on the longe, even
at the walk, he should be practiced going to the right until<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
equally capable on that hand. A horse should not be
longed until fatigued.</p>

<p><i>Use of the Longe.</i>—</p>

<p>1. To exercise young horses without injury.</p>

<p>2. To give first lessons to horses difficult to manage.</p>

<p>3. For horses that hold back or fight.</p>

<p>4. For horses with one shoulder more developed
than the other.</p>

<p>5. For horses that will not work equally well on
either hand.</p>

<p>6. For horses that bend themselves with difficulty.</p>

<p>7. For the first lessons in jumping. (<i>Notes d’Equitation.</i>)</p>

<p><i>The Snaffle Bit.</i>—As early as possible, a bridle and
snaffle bit should be put on the horse.</p>

<p>The snaffle is a very mild bit because it acts mostly
on the lips and only a little on the bars. The faults of
the hand are therefore less prejudicial to the tender
mouth of the new horse. When, in the course of training,
the horse becomes familiar with the snaffle bit, he
may be prepared for the double bridle by the use of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
double snaffle, a bit which is known not to be dangerous
and which gives the rider more action upon the horse.
The double snaffle should properly be composed of a
snaffle without branches and a “Boucher” snaffle. The
double snaffle also is useful in the case of a horse that
leans on the hands; the remedy consisting, in this case,
of producing action either by alternate effects which
make each snaffle bit felt separately, or by cross-effects
obtained by the action of one snaffle bit on one side and
the other snaffle bit on the other side.</p>

<p><i>Saddling New Horses.</i>—New horses should be made
accustomed to equipment while they are first exercised
by leading or when on the longe; first by the blanket and
surcingle, then by the saddle being placed on their back.
The saddle is put on first without stirrups, then with stirrups
crossed, and then with the stirrups hanging. The
girth should at first be tightened slightly, and afterwards
readjusted, if necessary, during the exercises. A nervous
horse should be longed a little before placing the
saddle on his back.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span></p>

<p>A horse should not be mounted for the first time on
the same day he is first saddled.</p>

<p><i>Mounting the New Horse.</i>—When first mounting,
the rider should get into the saddle as handily and quickly
as possible, without being particular as to exactness.
An assistant stands facing the horse. The rider slaps
the saddle, lets the stirrups drop against the sides of the
horse, and then takes up the reins, leaving them very
long. In case the horse backs up or tries to move away,
the assistant leads him gently up to where he was before
and the rider tries to mount again.</p>

<p>If the rider believes that the horse will make violent
resistances, he can insure his seat by having a rolled
blanket strapped to the pommel of the saddle, to keep his
knees in place. With a horse very difficult to mount,
where there is danger of severe resistance, the horse
should be snubbed up to a strong, quiet horse. Snubbing
is only resorted to in cases where longeing and quiet
handling have failed to bring about the desired results.</p>

<p>With very restless animals, the assistants stand
squarely in front of the horses and simply caress the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
animals’ heads without holding the reins. If a horse is
very restless, and the cavesson has to be used, it should
be in the hands of an experienced man.</p>

<p>The following is a position often taken for mounting
a restless animal: Take the reins of the snaffle in
the left hand, and with the same hand catch hold of the
mane at about the middle of the neck so that there is a
slight tension on the reins. Take hold of the pommel
of the saddle with the right hand and mount, taking care
that the left toe does not touch the horse when mounting.
Above all things, avoid bustling the horse when
starting; for, if he is led to expect this, he will never
stand quietly to be mounted. Sometimes feeding a horse
oats from a pan while he is being mounted causes him
to stand quietly.</p>

<p><i>First Lessons after Mounting.</i>—Never require anything
from the horse mounted for the first time. If he
walks straight ahead, it is sufficient. Keep the reins
separated and feel lightly the snaffle. Ride the horse
a few times around the hall to the right and to the left,
leaving him as free as possible, if, of course, he is quiet.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
If the horse does well, dismount and feed him carrots,
if they can be supplied, or a handful of oats. Carrots
ought always be cut lengthwise and never across; in the
latter case they might stick in the animal’s throat.</p>

<p><i>Resistances.</i>—Among the most violent resistances
are bucking and rearing.</p>

<p>If the horse attempts to buck, press him forward
with the legs and hold his head high. The rider is more
easily displaced if the horse bucks in place. If the rider
is not able to make the horse go forward, he should turn
him to the right or left with the snaffle bit. As all
horses have a soft and hard side to their mouths, when
resistance is encountered in turning to the right, the attempt
should be made to turn him to the left.</p>

<p>When a horse rears, separate the reins, and take
hold of the mane in the left hand at about the middle
of the neck. Lean forward, and when the horse comes
down again, push the body back into its place by quickly
straightening the arm.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span></p>

<h3>CHAPTER II.<br />
<span class="smcap">Equilibrium.</span></h3>

<p>A little must be understood about equilibrium before
the aids can properly be mastered.</p>

<p><i>Direct Equilibrium.</i>—This relates to the balance of
the horse when the center of gravity is moved forward
or backward. The fore legs of the horse are used for
translation, the hind legs for propulsion. The horse
naturally bears more weight upon his fore legs than upon
his hind. The center of gravity, then, is nearer the fore
quarters than the hind, which is therefore favorable to
the forward movement of the horse.</p>

<p>If the weight of the horse, by changing the position
of parts of the body, brings the center of gravity towards
the rear, it is more favorable for the backward
movement.</p>

<p>When the center of gravity is forward, the fore legs
control the movement of the mass, and the hind legs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
merely propel. When the center of gravity moves backward,
the hind legs become more and more masters of
the control of the movement of the mass, and their action
then is from the ground up as well as from rear to
front as before. In other words, the movements gain
in height.</p>

<p><i>Position of a Horse for the Forward Movement.</i>—</p>

<p>1. When a horse wants to move forward, he naturally
puts himself in the most favorable position; consequently
he throws his weight forward to his shoulders,
and, to do this, stretches out his head and neck.</p>

<p>2. To obtain the forward movement and the accelerations
in gait then, the rider must let the horse extend
and lower his head and neck; similarly he must
raise them to obtain the slower gaits.</p>

<p>3. <i>A horse must always be ready to carry himself
forward.</i> This is the most important rule in equitation.
The tendency to move forward is called “impulsion.”
Without impulsion we can have no influence over the
direction. (<i>De Saint-Phalle.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span></p>

<p>The horse must go into the bridle. Nearly every
vice and resistance offered by a horse is preceded and
made possible by the animal getting behind the bit; that
is, he refuses to face the bit, or take the pressure of the
bit, so that the rider’s hand can find nothing by which
he can enforce his demands. (<i>Anderson.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Lateral Equilibrium.</i>—This relates to the balance of
a horse when the center of gravity is moved sideways.
It is a case where the horse is made to load one shoulder
or one haunch or all one side more than the other. It
is used for changes of direction, parallel displacements,
etc. The horse being in motion, if we force him to carry
the weight of his forehand to one side, the entire forehand
tends to be displaced to the same side. This displacement
of the horse is obligatory if that of the center
of gravity is sufficiently accentuated.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">The Aids.</span></h4>

<p><i>What Are the Aids?</i>—The aids are the different
means employed by the rider to convey his desires or
intentions to the horse. (<i>Notes d’Equitation.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span></p>

<h5><span class="smcap">The Legs.</span></h5>

<p><i>The Stirrups.</i>—The stirrups should be so adjusted
that the tread of the stirrup is level with the top of the
heel when the rider is mounted and seated properly.
When the stirrups are too long, as with the “fork seat,”
the rider is unable to use his legs with strength and accuracy.
With the stirrups too short the rider’s knees are
too high, the seat is forced too far back and he is unable
to sit down in the saddle; hence is less secure.</p>

<p><i>Position of the Foot in the Stirrup.</i>—At least one-third
of the foot should be inserted in the stirrup; the
heel should be slightly lower than the toe and the ball
of the foot should rest upon the tread. (<i>Notes d’Equitation.</i>)</p>

<p>The following are the uses to which the legs
are put:</p>

<p>1. To produce the forward movement.</p>

<p>2. To range the haunches.</p>

<p>3. To bring the hind legs forward under the body.</p>

<p><i>The Equal Action of Both Legs.</i>—The most important
duty of the legs is to act together for the purpose of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
giving or sustaining impulsion. This action should command
the forward movement and its acceleration. To
obtain this result, the legs can act by simple pressure of
the knees or by pressure of the knees and calves. The
pressure of only the knees is sufficient with delicate
horses, but with others the pressure of the calves has to
be added to that of the knees. The more energetic the
pressure and the farther behind the girths it is, the greater
the result produced. Usually the action of the leg is
strong enough if it is placed against or a little in rear
of the girth. If the action there is not sufficient, it
may be carried back a little—never, however, to reach
an angle of 45 degrees. The perfection to aim at is to
have the leg move almost imperceptibly and vary its effects
only by different shades of pressure; but with a
horse that does not respond sufficiently to the demands,
it becomes necessary to carry the leg back a little by
bending the knee and keeping the heels low. The inclination
of the leg to an angle of 45 degrees is the very
maximum, which it is unscientific and useless to pass or
even to reach, so that if the action of the leg is not efficacious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
under these conditions, we must turn to more
energetic methods. But little trouble is experienced in
teaching riders not to carry the legs too far back. The
reverse is usually the case.</p>

<p>The above method failing, the next to try is consecutive
thumpings with the calf of the leg, not very pronounced,
but repeated until the result sought is obtained.
At the instant the legs should cease their action, and
should repeat it only when the need again is felt.</p>

<p>If this means is not sufficient, there is nothing to do
but come to blows with the legs. These are executed
by slightly carrying to one side the calf and ramming
it against the horse with a violence proportionate to the
result to be obtained. This movement ought to be done
without raising the knees or sticking them out, the lower
part of the legs being independent of the rest of the body
in order that the seat and the hand be not deranged.
This manner of getting action upon the horse ought not
to be continued for a long time, even if its effect is not
sufficient or lasting. Like every violent movement, this
one ought to be exceptional, and rather than repeat it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
frequently, it is better to have recourse to short, energetic
action of the spurs.</p>

<p>It is very necessary to avoid the frequent fault of
using the leg after sufficient action has been gotten out
of the horse or of continuing the demands when they are
already obeyed. Then the impulsion of the horse is augmented
in a manner prejudicial to the desired result,
which necessitates the action of the hand to oppose the
augmented impulsion falsely ordered by the legs.</p>

<p><i>Unequal Action of the Legs.</i>—When one leg is used
more than the other, the haunches are displaced to the
opposite side. The horse is then said “to range his
haunches.” This effect is often useful in preventing the
horse from slipping out sideways, in straightening him,
and in making him change directions, etc.; but its greatest
utility lies in permitting the rider to range the haunches
and traverse the horse, which movements are essential
to the main instruction in the mental and physical suppling
of the horse.</p>

<p>The rules for the use of both legs apply equally well
to the use of one leg, as regards place of contact and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
manner of graduating the intensity of action. (<i>“Equal
Action of Both Legs and Unequal Action of the Leg,”
from “Elementary Equitation,” by De Saint-Phalle.</i>)</p>

<p><i>To Bring the Hind Legs Forward Under the
Horse.</i>—Due to contraction of the muscles produced by
the tickling sensation of the leg or spur upon the side,
the horse mechanically brings his hind legs up under the
body when so forced. This bringing up of the hind legs
places the control of the movement of the mass in their
power, because the center of gravity is nearer their base.
Hence the leg movements become more elevated, the
speed less fast, and the horse more handy and more easily
controlled.</p>

<p><i>Mutual Support by the Legs.</i>—If one leg acts to
range the haunches, the other should receive the mass to
limit and control the movement. Both legs should be at
all times close enough to the horse to act accurately,
quickly, and without abruptness in order to assist each
other.</p>

<p><i>When a Horse Is “Behind the Legs.”</i>—When a horse
refuses to move forward after the equal action of both<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
legs is produced, he is said to be “behind the bit” and likewise
“behind the legs.” A horse in this state is beyond
the control of the rider, and every means should be exerted
to force the horse with the legs up into the bit
again.</p>

<p><i>The Spur.</i>—The spur should not be used until the
seat is secure. If the pressure of the calves of the legs
is sufficient to command impulsion, the spur should not
be resorted to.</p>

<p>Resistances are provoked if the spur remains in the
side continuously, and the animal becomes disobedient
and on the defensive. Continued contact should be replaced
by repeated contacts of short duration of an intensity
to fit the case.</p>

<p>The length of the spur varies with the length of the
stirrup-leathers, the length of the leg of the rider, and
the form of the horse. A general rule is that the spur
should be of such a length as to be easily used without
danger of unintentional usage during sudden displacements.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span></p>

<h5><span class="smcap">The Reins.</span></h5>

<p>In the training of the horse the reins should be held
in two hands. Single reins should be held as prescribed
in the Cavalry Drill Regulations.</p>

<p>The following important rule should always be observed:
<i>The pressure of the rider’s legs, or of his heels,
must always precede any action of the hand</i>; in other
words, the bit does not go back to the horse, but the horse
goes forward against the bit.</p>

<p>It has been shown that by the action of the legs impulsion
is produced in the horse, which causes a stretching
of the neck to the front in order to begin or accelerate
the forward movement. If as the head and neck
stretch out the forward movement of the bit in the mouth
is arrested by the hand, the bit is brought into stronger
contact with the bars of the mouth, which produces its
action. The action of the reins is thus produced after
the action of the legs has produced its effect.</p>

<h6><span class="smcap">Kinds of Reins.</span> (<i>De Saint-Phalle.</i>)</h6>

<p><i>Open Rein.</i>—This rein is used in turning the horse.
The right rein, for example, is said to be open if the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
right hand is carried to the right and front. Reins are
so used for the particular effect they have upon the
horse’s head. The need of them is felt especially in the
training of green horses, but also with a horse that refuses
to turn and carries his head in the opposite direction
from that in which the rider desires him to go.
When the right rein is open, the horse’s head will be
drawn to the right and he will be assisted in moving in
that direction.</p>

<p><i>Direct Rein.</i>—This rein acts parallel to the axis of
the horse without intermediary action upon the neck.
Reins used in this manner bring a little of the weight to
the side on which they act, which with an obedient horse
suffices to make him turn to that side. It is also used
in turning the horse’s head at the poll so that the horse
may look in the direction toward which he is going.</p>

<p><i>Rein of Support.</i>—The right rein, for example, is
called the right rein of support when the right hand
moves from right to left and the right rein hence bears
against the neck. It has different effects according to
the point towards which its action is directed. For example,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
if the hand is moved towards the front of or over
the left shoulder, the effect is to bring the weight of the
forehand towards that shoulder; or if the direction of
the right rein of support passes in rear of the withers,
the effect is felt by the increased weight on the left
haunch; or if the action of the rein in this direction is
sufficiently strong, it can either lead to the displacement
of the haunches towards the left by setting the left
shoulder, or displace simultaneously the shoulders and
the haunches towards the left by pushing the horse entirely
to that side.</p>

<p>The effect of the rein of support is extremely powerful
in preventing the horse from slipping out on its side,
or in restraining the horse from turning in the opposite
direction.</p>

<p><i>Rein of Opposition.</i>—If the rider opens the right
rein slightly and pulls either in the direction of the right
haunch or the direction of the left haunch, the rein is
called the right rein of opposition. He is then said to
set the shoulders in opposition to the haunches. (<i>Notes
d’Equitation.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span></p>

<p><i>General Rule.</i>—A general rule is, that at all times
contact is kept with the mouth by the reins through the
medium of the bit. <i>The reins never flop.</i> There are
two exceptions to this rule allowable: during complete
abandon, as at the walk; and momentarily, during flexions,
as will be shown later.</p>

<p><i>The Seat.</i>—The seat is an aid when it changes the
support of the body from one buttock to the other to
assist the horse in lateral movements. This movement
helps to carry the center of gravity of the horse to the
side toward which the movement is desired. Similarly
an increase in the weight placed on one stirrup is an aid.</p>

<p>The upper part of the body by leaning forward or
back likewise assists the horse in moving the center of
gravity forward and back.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span></p>

<h3>CHAPTER III.<br />
<span class="smcap">The Forward Movement.</span></h3>

<p>The horse being now able to be mounted, the following
exercises may be undertaken:</p>

<p>The horses are taken into the riding-hall, if available,
and the riders instructed to work without regard to distances.
It is a bad plan to work in groups, especially
with young horses, as they soon become accustomed to
remaining in ranks and refuse to leave.</p>

<p>The forward movement, as has been stated, is the
most important lesson in training, and it is continually
taught during the entire course of instruction.</p>

<p><i>The Walk.</i>—To take the walk from the halt, both
legs should be made to be felt, gradually increasing their
intensity until the setting in motion is produced. The
fingers and wrists give, to allow the neck to stretch out.
The horse should be set in motion in the direction of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
axis by symmetrical use of the aids. The movement
should be smooth, but without hesitancy.</p>

<p>In order to keep the start from being sudden, the
energy displayed in the use of the leg should conform to
the degree of sensitiveness of the horse. The movement
can be kept from being hesitatingly performed by progressively,
but without hesitancy, using such force as the
legs should have, and by giving the reins with the fingers
and wrist at the precise moment the neck tries to
stretch out.</p>

<p><i>The Trot.</i>—This is the most advantageous gait to
take during the first lessons, because:</p>

<p>1. It starts the horse straight ahead and helps to
bring him in hand.</p>

<p>2. Horses are less restless at this gait.</p>

<p>3. It is a natural pace.</p>

<p>4. It is a good suppling exercise for the horse.</p>

<p>The trot is not a fatiguing pace to the horse. He
can go a long distance continuously at a fair rate of
speed at this gait, because both fore and hind legs, respectively,
have the same amount of work to do, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
body can be easily maintained in a state of equilibrium,
as it is supported by diagonal supports.</p>

<p>The rider, if in the flat saddle, except at slow gaits,
should rise to the trot during this exercise. The diagonal
on which the rise is made should frequently be
changed.</p>

<p>The lightness of the horse only comes with further
training. The rider up to this point tries little by little
to bring the horse under control by the following
exercises:</p>

<p>1. Moving to the front at a walk, then a trot.</p>

<p>2. Increasing and decreasing gaits.</p>

<p>3. Halting.</p>

<p><i>To Halt.</i>—To execute this movement, lean back
slightly and gradually increase the pressure of the bit
on the mouth until the movement slows down and gradually
stops. Both legs should at the same time be carried
back to assist the horse in bringing the haunches up under
him. The horse should neither raise nor lower his head.
The whole mass of the neck should move toward the
withers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span></p>

<p>Halting the horse should often be practiced with
horses possessing a high, powerful croup and with those
inclined to forge ahead at all times. Those inclined to
fret, those whose legs are well set up under them, and
those that are difficult to keep up into the bit should seldom
be halted.</p>

<p>Especially during these lessons must the rider pay
strict attention to the even tension of the rein. At first
the rider must do all the work—that is, must tighten the
reins; but later the horse, having become accustomed to
the pressure of the bit and always having the idea of going
straight ahead, will of his own accord keep the reins
taut.</p>

<p><i>The Gallop.</i>—Almost invariably the gallop lesson
should be begun early. This is an additional means of
suppling the horse, of strengthening him, extending him,
and pushing him straight ahead. It would be stupidity
to gallop frequently on a colt that drags his legs and is
disunited at a trot and that has difficulty in holding up
the part essential to the training. On the other hand,
it is proper to gallop repeatedly on a vigorous horse that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
has been worked before purchase, or on the horse with
good strong legs, particularly after he has been thoroughly
confirmed in the correct trot. (<i>Notes d’Equitation.</i>)</p>

<p><i>To Take the Gallop by Extending the Trot.</i>—To accomplish
this movement, the rider needs only to take the
trot and by the use of both legs to push this gait up to
the point where the horse leaves it to pass into the gallop.</p>

<p>To accomplish this without undue increase of speed,
put the horse on a circle of six or seven yards radius,
first trot around this and then lengthen the trot until the
horse escapes into the gallop. When he is calm and the
rider feels confidence in himself, the rider may leave the
circle and rejoin the track on the same hand.</p>

<p>As long as the rider does not wish to make abrupt
changes of direction, but gallops on a large circle or on
the track, it makes little difference whether the horse is
galloping true or false, and it is useless for the rider to
bother about the leads at this stage of the training. (<i>De
Saint-Phalle.</i>)</p>

<p>When the horse begins to understand the gallop and
takes it calmly, the correct lead, which is explained on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
page 61, may be undertaken, at present, by the following
aids: Both legs to increase the gait from the trot to the
gallop; outside rein to prevent the haunches from swinging
to the outside and which precludes the liability to a
false lead.</p>

<p>(<i>Note.</i>—“Outside” always means the outside of a
circle, or, if on the track, the side towards the wall.)</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span></p>

<h3>CHAPTER IV.<br />
<span class="smcap">Mechanism of the Gaits.</span></h3>

<p><i>The Walk.</i>—This is a movement of four beats, and
is a pace in which all the legs move, respectively, one
after the other. If, for instance, the left fore leads, the
sequence is:</p>

<ul>
<li>1. Left fore.</li>
<li>2. Right hind.</li>
<li>3. Right fore.</li>
<li>4. Left hind.</li>
</ul>

<p>If the near hind begins, it will be:</p>

<ul>
<li>1. Left hind.</li>
<li>2. Left fore.</li>
<li>3. Right hind.</li>
<li>4. Right fore.</li>
</ul>

<p>Each foot comes to the ground after the one that
precedes it at an interval of about half the time occupied
taking one step. The result of this is that we have the
following order of supports:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span></p>

<ul>
<li>1. Right laterals (right fore and right hind).</li>
<li>2. Right diagonals (right fore and left hind).</li>
<li>3. Left laterals.</li>
<li>4. Left diagonals.</li>
</ul>

<p>As a rule, a horse begins the walk with a fore leg.
(<i>Hayes.</i>)</p>

<p><i>The Trot.</i>—This is a movement of two beats. The
diagonal feet are on the ground at the same time. The
order of supports is:</p>

<ul>
<li>1. Right diagonal.</li>
<li>2. Moment of suspension.</li>
<li>3. Left diagonal.</li>
<li>4. Moment of suspension.</li>
</ul>

<p><i>The Pace.</i>—This is a movement of two beats, like
the trot, except the support is by the laterals instead of
the diagonals. The order of supports is:</p>

<ul>
<li>1. Right lateral.</li>
<li>2. Moment of suspension.</li>
<li>3. Left lateral.</li>
<li>4. Moment of suspension.</li>
</ul>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span></p>

<p><i>The Gallop.</i>—The gallop is an unsymmetrical gait
of three beats. It is called unsymmetrical because the
two front legs make dissimilar movements, likewise the
two hind. Two different combinations take place, which
are called “gallop right” and “gallop left.” The moment
of taking each new point of support is called a beat.</p>

<p>In the gallop right the points of support are taken
in the following order:</p>

<ul>
<li>1. Left hind.</li>
<li>2. Left diagonal (left front, right hind).</li>
<li>3. Right front.</li>
<li>4. Moment of suspension.</li>
</ul>

<p>The gallop left is as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li>1. Right hind.</li>
<li>2. Right diagonal (right front, left hind).</li>
<li>3. Left front.</li>
<li>4. Moment of suspension.</li>
</ul>

<p>A horse galloping right, for instance, seems to have
the right legs always in front of the left. The rider can
tell by seeing if the right shoulder is further advanced
than the left. If the horse gallops right in front and left
behind, the rider can feel an unusual stiff movement beneath
him.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span></p>

<h3>CHAPTER V.<br />
<span class="smcap">Changes of Direction.</span></h3>

<p>The horse being able to move forward and to decrease
and increase gaits with reasonable accuracy,
changes of direction may be undertaken.</p>

<p><i>First Exercise.</i>—The horse being at the walk, force
the horse forward with both legs, use the open rein, and
if he moves off at an angle oblique to the original direction,
although the divergence may be small, it is
satisfactory.</p>

<p><i>Second Exercises.</i>—The horse being at the walk, use
the right or left leg to help carry the haunches around
to the left or right; use the right or left rein of opposition
to turn the horse to the right or left in a direction
perpendicular to the original. The rein of opposition is
used to combat the haunches with the shoulder. The
horse not yet knowing the meaning of the preponderant
use of one leg of the rider, the shoulder combating the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
haunch will make the haunch swing around, and if the
horse, every time he is obliged to swing his haunches
by the rein of opposition, feels the rider’s leg on that
side, he will begin to associate the use of the leg with the
swinging of the haunches.</p>

<p><i>Third Exercise.</i>—As the horse begins to understand
the meaning of the use of one leg, gradually lessen
the use of the rein of opposition as an open rein, until
it finally becomes a direct rein, used only to turn the head
slightly in the new direction. As the rein of opposition,
or open rein, is diminished, supposing it to have been the
right rein, gradually bring into play the left rein of support
to force the fore quarters to the right in the new
direction. As to the legs: Have both ready to maintain
the impulsion, and each ready to act singly in case
the hind feet do not follow in the track of the fore feet
in making the change of direction. The hind legs being
the propellers, and the maximum of power being always
desirable, for purely mechanical reasons the greatest
power of the hind legs is obtained when they follow in
the same path as the fore legs, during turns.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span></p>

<p>(<i>Note.</i>—The third exercise should not be undertaken
until the horse has accomplished most of the exercises
of Lateral Equitation, explained in following chapters.)</p>

<p>Abouts, circles, figures of eight, and serpentines are
exercises, named in order of difficulty, which may be undertaken
to accomplish the same result as the above
exercises, with greater exactness. All these exercises
should be practiced at the walk until proficient before
attempting them at the slow trot. The rider sits the
slow trot.</p>

<p><i>The About on the Forehand at a Halt.</i>—With
horses that are naturally impulsive and are continually
endeavoring to forge to the front, abouts on the forehand
from the halt may be practiced at this stage of the training.
With horses of exaggerated impulsiveness it may
sometimes be undertaken earlier. The exercise should
come later for less impulsive horses. The movement
should always be completed by moving the horse straight
to the front. The about on the forehand should always
be about the inside leg as a pivot, for otherwise the movement
is a retrograde one and tends to put the horse behind
the bit.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span></p>

<p>It must be understood that at this stage of training,
that is, during lateral equitation (explained on page 50),
the about on the forehand is not a finished movement.
The aids to be used are: To execute an about on the
forehand to the right; both legs to arouse impulsion; the
right leg to swing the haunches; the right rein of opposition
to assist the right leg; the left rein to assist the
right in its second function of preventing the horse from
moving forward. The left leg is always ready to prevent
the horse from backing.</p>

<p><i>About on the Forehand (Dismounted).</i>—With some
horses that are particularly difficult to teach the use of
the leg as an aid, dismounted work may be resorted to.
Short lessons only should be given.</p>

<p>Working on the left side, seize the reins six or eight
inches from the bit in the left hand. Stand facing the
horse and with the riding-whip touch him in rear of the
girth where the rider’s leg would ordinarily come when
used as an aid. Increase the force of the whip, beginning
with light taps, until the horse swings his haunches
away from the whip. The left hand prevents the horse<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
moving either forward or backward. If at first the
horse fails to move his haunches, he may be assisted in
doing so by bringing the head slightly toward the side
of the trainer. This opposes the head to the haunches
and assists the action of the whip.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span></p>

<h3>CHAPTER VI.<br />
<span class="smcap">Outdoor Work.</span></h3>

<p>From the moment the horse will go straight ahead
outdoor work is in some cases a necessity and in all cases
to a greater or less extent desirable.</p>

<p>Horses which tend to get behind the bit or which do
not let themselves out should frequently have outside
work alternated with hall work. The horse being gradually
educated to a good free trot should be given them
outdoors, allowing time enough between trots for the
horse to assume normal breathing. Outdoor work should
take place with normal horses two days a week.</p>

<p>All horses need fresh outdoor air occasionally.</p>

<p>Horses that are inclined to bolt or forge ahead continually,
or those that throw most of the weight on the
forehand, need much more hall work than outdoor work.</p>

<p>Young horses especially should be given trots on
soft ground. No horse should be galloped on hard roads.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
Soft ground means turf or dirt roads, not plowed land
or stone-built roads. The gallop is undertaken outdoors
only when the horse can be made to lead from either foot.</p>

<p>By going in pairs nervous horses do not fret while
outdoors, as much as though alone. It is likewise better
not to maintain a formation in ranks while outdoors,
any more than necessary, in order to prevent the new
horses from acquiring the habit of going in ranks and
refusing to leave.</p>

<p>During the last part of outdoor exercise the horse
should be walked so that he is returned to the stable
breathing normally.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER VII.<br />
<span class="smcap">Suppling Exercises With Body Bent.</span></h3>

<p><i>Different Kinds of Equitation.</i>—When, for example,
the <i>right</i> rein and <i>left</i> leg are used to assist each other
in moving the haunches, it is called lateral equitation.
When the reins place the forehand and the legs alone
control the hindhand, as, for example, if the <i>left</i> rein
and <i>right</i> leg are used, it is called diagonal equitation.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Lateral Equitation.</span></h4>

<p>The following points should be considered during
the exercises in lateral equitation:</p>

<p>1. One step taken correctly is at first all that should
be expected or required.</p>

<p>2. As the movements are fatiguing, they should at
no time be continued more than a few seconds.</p>

<p>3. Horses that are stiff on one particular side
should be suppled by exercises to that side.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span></p>

<p>4. The preceding rule applies to all parts of the
horse except the neck. If the neck is stiff on the right
side, supple it by exercises, as “Shoulder In” (see below),
on the left hand. (<i>Capt. Short.</i>)</p>

<p>5. The movements are all begun at a walk and,
when proficient in them, are executed at a slow trot.</p>

<p>6. When the movements are executed on a circle,
where the fore quarters are on one circumference and the
hind quarters either on a larger or a smaller circumference,
the effect, besides being one of suppling, is as follows:
When the haunches are on a smaller circumference
the horse tends toward collection, his hind quarters
tend to come up under the body, and it is a good movement
for a horse that forges ahead; when the hind quarters
are on a circle of greater circumference than the fore
quarters the horse tends to be forced up into the bit and
to stretch out behind, hence it is a useful movement with
sluggish horses or horses that tend to get behind the bit.</p>

<p>7. When executing any of the following exercises,
if the horse fails to respond to the action of both legs
and does not go up into the bit, cease the exercise at once<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
and move straight ahead at a trot or gallop and do not
return to the exercise until the horse is again into the bit.</p>

<p><i>First Exercise in Suppling the Haunches.</i>—This lesson
consists in abouts on the forehand while marching.
For example, marching on the right hand, leave the track
on a diagonal (oblique) and return to it by a half turn to
the left exacted by a very pronounced action of the left
leg and left rein. This strongly marked lateral effect
carries the horse’s haunches to the right; that is to say,
the horse while still gaining ground yields to the effect
of the leg (and left rein), and thus describes a half turn.
The same movement is executed while marching on the
left hand and the horse eventually swings the haunches
easily about the forehand, without halting, without striking
the fetlocks, and without dancing. (<i>Notes d’Equitation.</i>)</p>

<p>The commands for this exercise are:</p>

<ul>
<li>1. Right oblique.</li>
<li>2. <i>March.</i></li>
<li>1. On forehand.</li>
<li>2. Half turn in reverse.</li>
<li>3. <i>March.</i></li>
</ul>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span></p>

<p>“Half turn” and “reverse” could, in this case, be
expressed “left half turn,” but “in reverse” has particular
significance, and the terms should be retained on
that account.</p>

<p><i>Haunches In.</i>—This movement is one to exact obedience
to one leg while marching. It continues the suppling
of the hind quarters and confirms the obedience
to the leg. It should be undertaken only when the horse
yields readily to the legs in previous exercises.</p>

<p>Marching on the right hand, use the left rein of opposition
and the left leg. It is sufficient if the horse
swings his haunches to the right so that the left hind
foot steps on a line passing through the prints of the right
fore foot. The left rein of opposition assists the action
of the left leg. At first one step is sufficient to demand
at a time. Repeat the movement several times, gradually
demanding more steps in the correct position. Never demand
the movement, at any one time, over a greater distance
than the long side of the riding-hall. The following
cautions should be carefully observed:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span></p>

<p>1. Never let the horse’s body make an angle of
more than 45 degrees with the original direction. To
prevent this, use the inside leg.</p>

<p>2. Never let the gait diminish. To prevent this,
use both legs when necessary to demand impulsion.</p>

<p>3. Do not lean to the left when moving to the right.
The weight of the body should be slightly more upon the
right buttock when moving to the right.</p>

<p>4. Do not let the right rein be slack when moving
to the right.</p>

<p><i>Shoulder In.</i>—This is a similar exercise to haunches
in, but more difficult and more useful.</p>

<p>This movement supples both forehand and hindhand.</p>

<p>To execute the movement when marching on the
right hand:</p>

<p>First use the right open rein and the left rein of
support, the fore quarters are then moved off the track
and the head turned to the right; the right leg is then used
to push the mass from right to left and the left leg to
receive the swinging of the haunches and to control the
impulsion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Cautions to Be Observed</i>:</p>

<p>1. During the first lessons, after the fore quarters
have been moved off the track, to facilitate the movement
along the track, the outside rein may be slightly opened.</p>

<p>2. The reins prevent the lateral flexion of the neck
at the shoulders by holding the head firmly between them.</p>

<p>3. The fore quarters are sufficiently removed from
the track if the left fore foot and right hind travel along
the same path parallel to the track.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span></p>

<h3>CHAPTER VIII.<br />
<span class="smcap">Diagonal Equitation.</span></h3>

<h4><span class="smcap">Exercises with Body Straight.</span></h4>

<p><i>General Rules for Diagonal Equitation</i>:</p>

<p>1. Perfection is gained when the body of the horse
from the poll back is in a straight line.</p>

<p>2. The horse’s head is always turned slightly at the
poll to enable him to see in the direction he is going.</p>

<p>3. The reins set or place the forehand.</p>

<p>4. The legs govern the hindhand.</p>

<p>5. The green horse is never passaged directly to
the right or left. The direction of motion should not
be more than 45 degrees from the direction of the axis
of the horse.</p>

<p><i>Work on Two Tracks.</i>—This movement consists in
displacing the horse parallel to himself in a direction oblique
to that of his axis, the front and hind legs describing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
four parallel tracks. The exterior members cross
over the interior ones.</p>

<p>The following are the aids in order to move a horse
on two tracks to the right:</p>

<p>1. Both legs, if sufficient momentum is not already
obtained, should send the horse up into the bit to receive
the indications of the reins.</p>

<p>2. The right direct rein makes the horse look to the
side toward which he should march, and by throwing the
weight slightly to the right begins the displacement of
the center of gravity towards the right. The left rein
of support acts at the same time as the preceding, to insure
the lateral displacement of the forehand to the right
by further displacing the center of gravity.</p>

<p>3. The left leg, at this moment, becomes preponderant
in order to direct the haunches to the right, while
the right leg acts if necessary to limit the displacement
of the haunches, and to oblige the horse to maintain his
gait and to gain ground to the front as well as to the side.</p>

<p>4. The seat is displaced towards the right to aid
the horse’s movement to that side. (<i>De Saint-Phalle.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span></p>

<p>The following are exercises on two tracks:</p>

<p>1. <i>On Two Tracks, Haunches In.</i>—A two-track
movement along the track, with the head to the wall, in
which the haunches move on an inside track, the horse
being in the position described above for the work on two
tracks and being governed by similar aids.</p>

<p>2. <i>On Two Tracks, Haunches Out.</i>—Same as above,
except the croup is to the wall and the fore quarters move
on an inside track, the hind quarters on the track.</p>

<p>3. <i>On Two Tracks on the Diagonal.</i>—A movement
in which a horse moves across the hall on the diagonal
on two tracks.</p>

<p>4. <i>On Two Tracks on a Circle.</i>—Described by its
name. The haunches being on a smaller or larger circle
than the fore quarters. The same principles apply
in each case as described for work on two tracks.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Commands.</span></h4>

<p><i>For First Exercise.</i>—1. On two tracks. 2. Haunches
in. 3. March.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span></p>

<p><i>For Second Exercise.</i>—1. On two tracks. 2.
Haunches out. 3. March.</p>

<p><i>For Third Exercise.</i>—1. On two tracks. 2. Right
oblique. 3. March.</p>

<p><i>For Fourth Exercise.</i>—1. On two tracks. 2.
Haunches in (or out). 3. March. (<i>Foot-note to Saumur
Notes.</i>)</p>

<p><i>About on the Forehand at a Halt.</i>—To execute this
movement from left to right the aids are as follows:</p>

<p>1. Carry the weight of the mass over the shoulders
by the equal action of both legs.</p>

<p>2. Just as the horse is about to move out, close the
fingers on the reins and prevent further advance.</p>

<p>3. Use the right rein of support to bring the weight
upon the left shoulder.</p>

<p>4. Use the left direct rein to turn the horse’s head
to the left at the poll.</p>

<p>5. Use the left leg to move the haunches to the
right.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span></p>

<p>6. The right leg remains ready to maintain the advanced
position of the center of gravity and likewise to
limit the movement of the haunches to that side.</p>

<p>7. The seat should be carried to the right to facilitate
the displacement of the haunches to that side.</p>

<p><i>About on the Haunches.</i>—This movement is more
difficult than the about on the forehand and should be
undertaken only after the work on two tracks is well
understood.</p>

<p>The movement is first taught by moving the horse
on two tracks on a small circle; for example, to the right,
with haunches in.</p>

<p>Gradually decrease the diameter of the circle as the
horse becomes proficient. As the circle becomes smaller
change the direction of the rein so that the direction of
the pull is toward the right haunch to weight the latter
down. Likewise increase the pressure of the left leg until
it is sufficient to prevent little by little any movement
on the part of the haunches. The circle then is finally
diminished so that the movement is that of a circle on
the part of the forehand about the right hind leg as a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
pivot. If the movement should be about the left hind
leg, or outside leg, as a pivot, it becomes a retrograde
movement, which is liable to put the horse behind the bit.</p>

<p><i>The Gallop.</i>—Heretofore the gallop has been undertaken
merely as a means of exercise to strengthen and
stretch out the horse and to teach him a little in balancing
himself by the use of his legs. No attention was
paid at first to the leads; later a little lateral equitation
was used to partially insure the correct lead.</p>

<p>A horse is leading correctly when the right laterals
(right front and right hind) are in advance of the left
laterals, when turning to the right. This is called “leading
right.” A horse is galloping disunited when he is
galloping one way in front and another way in rear.</p>

<p>On small circles or sudden turns of direction a horse
is liable to fall if not leading correctly.</p>

<p><i>The Right Lead.</i>—To require a horse to lead to the
right, the aids are:</p>

<p>1. Weight of the body to the left, weight in left
stirrup in order to weight down the left haunch.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span></p>

<p>2. Use of the left leg to cause the haunches to be
displaced to the right consequently requiring the right
lateral to pass the left.</p>

<p>3. Use the right leg to join its action to that of
the left to give the necessary impulsion and to receive
the haunches and prevent their being moved too far to
the right.</p>

<p>The horse being driven by the legs up into the bit,
is received by the reins in the following manner:</p>

<p>4. Right rein of support exerted in a direction toward
the left shoulder to weight the latter, for it must
be slowed down; at the same time this movement frees
the right shoulder and allows it to extend itself. The
horse is made to slightly turn the head to the right at
the poll in order that he may see in the direction in which
he is going.<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span></p>

<p>5. Left direct rein corroborates the action of the
right and keeps the neck straight. (<i>De Saint-Phalle.</i>)</p>

<p>6. If the gallop is taken from the trot while posting,
rising with the right diagonal assists the right lead.
Rising from the left diagonal assists the left lead.</p>

<p>When perfection is attained, the horse does not perceptibly
swing his haunches to the right or left.</p>

This method is taught by some of the best authorities in our
service. It certainly can be reasoned out as well as that mentioned
above, it is more easy to put in practice and produces results
in a scientific manner.</p>

<p>“1. Use the left direct rein to weight the left shoulder.</p>

<p>“2. Exert sufficient pressure on the right rein to keep the
head from being turned to the left, so that the horse may see
where he is going, and at the same time raise the right hand
slightly to assist in lightening the weight on the right shoulder,
thereby assisting to free it.”</p>

<h3>CHAPTER IX.<br />
<span class="smcap">Backing.</span></h3>

<p>This exercise is a suppling one for back and haunches,
and is especially applicable to horses who have difficulty
in bringing the hind legs under the body. It is an
exercise which to the unskillful is dangerous, as it tends
to put a horse behind the bit. To the skillful it is of
course less dangerous yet it should not be undertaken
by either until this point in the education of the horse
is reached, provided he be normal. With horses that are
very difficult to hold, or are continually bolting, backing
exercises may be undertaken earlier in the training.</p>

<p>The movement may be advantageously taught dismounted
at first.</p>

<p><i>Teaching the Backward Movement, Dismounted</i>:—The
trainer stands facing the horse. He takes the reins
one in each hand and slightly lowers the head to relieve
the weight on the hind quarters. He then makes a slight<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
movement with his hands towards his own body, sufficient
to prepare the horse to move forward. As the
horse is about to move out the trainer presses directly
toward the horse with the bit until the horse takes a step
to the rear. One step at first is sufficient.</p>

<p>After a few lessons of this, the trainer steps to the
left side of the horse, with the reins in the left hand, the
riding-whip in the right. He stimulates the hind quarters
with a light touch of the whip, and as the horse starts
to move his hind quarters up under his body he urges
him to take a step to the rear by the pressure of the bit.
As soon as he takes a step or two as desired, he leads him
forward.</p>

<p><i>Mounted.</i>—When the horse can perform the last
exercise well, mount him. Use the aids required to
move the horse to the front; then, just as he is about to
move out, increase the pressure of the reins and lean
slightly back until the horse steps to the rear. As soon
as the horse at first has taken a single step to the rear he
should be moved straight to the front. Later several
steps to the rear may be required, but a movement to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
front always follows the last step. If difficulty is at any
time encountered in moving the horse forward after the
backward movement, backing should cease as an exercise
until the horse is sent up into the bit again.</p>

<p>If the horse sets himself, move him forward a step
or two, and as he is moving exert the aids for the backward
movement until he obeys. Moving a horse’s
haunches laterally will help to prevent a horse from setting
himself and refusing to back.</p>

<p>This exercise should not be repeated often in a single
day.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span></p>

<h2>PART II.</h2>

<h3>CHAPTER I.<br />
<span class="smcap">The Double Bridle.</span></h3>

<p>The horse that can perform successfully the foregoing
exercises, that has found his balance while moving
forward, that is easy to control by the aids at the walk
and trot, and that has learned the use of his legs in accomplishing
a good walk, trot, and gallop, is ready for
the double bridle. It normally takes about three months
to accomplish this.</p>

<p><i>Definition.</i>—The double bridle is one with usually
four cheek straps, which fasten, one into the eye of the
curb bit the other into the ring of the snaffle bit.</p>

<p>The curb bit is nearer the front of the horse’s mouth
than the snaffle, and the curb chain likewise passes in
front of the snaffle bit.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span></p>

<p><i>The Severity of the Curb Bit Increases</i>—</p>

<p>1. With the difference between the length of the
upper and lower branches.</p>

<p>2. With the tightness of the curb chain.</p>

<p>3. With the height of the port.</p>

<p>4. Inversely with the size of the canons. (<i>De
Saint-Phalle.</i>)</p>

<p>Bits with branches similar in length to the U. S. regulation
bit are arranged below in order of mildness:</p>

<p>1. The broken curb bit. (Like a snaffle bit, but
with upper and lower branches and curb chain.)</p>

<p>2. Rubber- and leather-covered bits.</p>

<p>3. The straight bar bit.</p>

<p>4. The regulation bit.</p>

<p><i>Kinds.</i>—The “Weymouth” or “Pump” bit is quite
universally used for polo. Why it is considered efficacious
for polo especially is not known. It is a good bit,
except the lips are liable to become pinched.</p>

<p>The “Pelham” is a bit provided with rings for the
snaffle rein at the junction of the canon with the branches.
The action of the curb reins on this bit does not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
produce the same effect, when the snaffle reins are used
at the same time, as it does on a curb bit, where the snaffle
reins are attached to a separate snaffle bit.</p>

<p>It is a general rule to follow, that all complicated
bits are useless, and that with a well-trained horse the
mildest bit that will insure obedience is the correct one.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Schedule for Accustoming the Horse to the
Curb Bit.</span></h4>

<p>The reins are held in both hands, snaffle reins outside
the little fingers.</p>

<p>1. Use the curb bit without curb chain until the
horse becomes accustomed to it.</p>

<p>2. Use the mildest bit available and fasten the curb
chain loosely. At first only move on straight lines until
the horse takes the bit quietly, then execute simple exercises
in which the horse is proficient. These exercises
at first are begun on the snaffle bit.</p>

<p>3. Use the bit best adapted to the horse, and set
the curb chain to keep the bit from falling through.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
Work mainly on the snaffle bit until the horse becomes
accustomed to the bit and curb chain.</p>

<p>The preceding movements should be begun at first
at a slow gait.</p>

<p><i>Use.</i>—The curb bit is used primarily, in training, to
lower the head, to flex the jaw, and to bring the nose in
towards the body.</p>

<p>The snaffle bit raises the head and supports the horse.</p>

<p>A curb bit will not stop a horse that makes up his
mind to bolt.</p>

<p>A curb bit roughly used may cause a horse to make up his
mind to bolt.</p>

<p>A “hard mouth” is often a tender mouth accustomed
to hard hands.</p>

<p><i>The Curb Bit “Gathers” the Horse.</i>—A horse is
gathered when his head and neck are well raised, the
front line of the face nearly vertical, and the jaw and
the junction of the head and neck at the poll flexible.</p>

<p>A horse in a state of “collection” is in a position to
obey, to the utmost of his capability, any demands the
aids may give.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span></p>

<p>A horse is in “collection” when he is gathered and
his hind legs are well up under the body.</p>

<p>When a horse is collected, the rider, by having omitted
bending the neck near the shoulders during training,
has the neck firm on the shoulders and not flexible or
“rubber-necked.” Hence the rider acts on the neck
through the mouth and on the shoulders through the
neck. The hind quarters by being under the horse bind
themselves to the forehand. The rider then by acting
on the forehand acts likewise upon the hind quarters.</p>

<p>The entire body of the horse should be, if properly
collected, an energetic and harmonious whole. The
horse is “in hand,” because his jaw is flexible and he
yields to the effects of the bit. The horse is light or
handy, because he is balanced by continual training and
because his center of gravity is equally near both front
and hind quarters; hence the proper movement on the
part of the rider will disturb this balance in any direction
desired.</p>

<p>The rider at this point, being supposed to be able to
get the hind legs up under the horse, must learn to gather
him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span></p>

<p>To gather the horse involves:</p>

<p>1. Direct flexion (the flexion of the jaw and head
in the direction of the axis of the horse.)</p>

<p>2. Lateral flexion (the flexion of the neck at the
poll in a direction perpendicular to the axis of the horse).</p>

<p><i>Direct Flexion.</i>—Direct flexion is the concession the
head and lower jaw of the horse make in the vertical
plane of the axis, of the horse when the action of the
reins arrests the extension of the neck. The giving of the
neck is confined to the upper portions; the front line of
the face is made to approach a vertical line and the head
is made to make in an almost imperceptible manner a
movement analogous to a nod.</p>

<p>The giving of the jaw consists in opening the mouth,
causing complete abandon of the bit, followed <i>immediately</i>
by the closing of the mouth and the taking up of contact
with the bit again.</p>

<p>To flex the jaw in direct flexion, first start the horse
into a walk. Never let the gait slacken during flexion.
Close the legs. When the horse goes up into the bit,
close one hand on one snaffle rein (if the movement is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
done with a snaffle bit), or close the hand on both curb
reins. Do not make the pressure of long duration if resistance
is encountered. Alternate the action, first by
releasing, then increasing the pressure. This is more
uncomfortable to the horse than continued pressure, and
he will soon yield.</p>

<p>The head is flexed in direct flexion so that it is set
with the front line of the face nearly vertical by the action
of both curb reins. The head and neck are raised by the
snaffle bit, should they be lowered too much.</p>

<p><i>Lateral Flexion.</i>—Lateral flexion is a concession
which the head and neck make by turning the head to
the right or to the left when an opposing action of the
reins stops an extension of the neck. The jaw gives
in lateral flexion as in direct flexion. The neck gives by
making the head make a turn of a quarter of a circle to
the right or left at the poll.</p>

<p>Lateral flexion should be demanded, in the beginning,
at the walk. To obtain it, to the right, for example:
first, resistance must be offered by the right direct
rein, which leads the head into the desired position; the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
left rein then acts to limit this movement and to work
together with the right rein to obtain the concession of
the jaw.</p>

<p>Flexion may be made dismounted, if absolutely impossible
of execution mounted.</p>

<p><i>Direct Flexion Dismounted.</i>—Stand on the near side
of the horse. Take the snaffle reins off the neck over
the horse’s head and hold them a few inches in front of
his head with the left hand. Urge the horse forward
into a walk and raise the head slightly to the proper elevation
with the snaffle reins. When the horse moves out
at the walk, take the curb reins in the right hand and assimilate
the movement of the reins as though flexing the
jaw mounted. Do not let the horse slacken speed or, at
any cost, back up.</p>

<p><i>Lateral Flexion Dismounted.</i>—Stand on the near
side, with the snaffle rein held as for direct flexion. Execute
direct flexion and when performed lead the horse’s
head to the right with a snaffle rein, increasing the pressure
of the right curb rein slightly until the head is turned
to the right at the poll. Do not let the horse move backward,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
nor let the neck flex in rear of the poll. The maximum
movement of the head is over an arc of a circle
of 90 degrees.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER II.<br />
<span class="smcap">The Change of Lead at the Gallop.</span></h3>

<p>This movement is to be undertaken when the horse
is capable of taking the desired lead from a trot on a
straight line.</p>

<p>1. Put the horse on a circle of large radius, at
a gallop. Leave the circle by a line parallel to the diagonal
of the riding-hall and form another large circle to
the opposite hand, keeping the same lead at the gallop
as on the first circle. Galloping on the second circle with
the same lead as on the first is galloping “false.” Besides
lowering the croup and balancing the horse, the
false lead impresses the aids upon the horse, because to
maintain a false lead the aids used on the first circle
must be more strongly used on the second.</p>

<p>2. Gallop the horse on a straight line, leading right.
Bring him down to a trot, previously having changed
the aids to gallop left, which assists in bringing the horse<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
to the trot and prepares the way for the next move. As
soon as the trot is taken, increase the aids of gallop left,
increase the impulsion, and send the horse into gallop
left, with only a few steps of the trot intervening between
gallops. Gradually, as the horse becomes proficient,
decrease the number of steps taken at the trot.</p>

<p>3. When the amount of trot required between
changes of lead is hardly more than a slackening of
speed, or “half halt,” make a large circle to the right at
the gallop, leading right. Leave the circle on the diagonal,
as before, and make another circle to the left, holding
the right lead. Change the aids, while on the second
circle, to gallop left, without coming to the trot, and force
the horse into the change of lead.</p>

<p>4. When the horse can accomplish the above, attempt
the change of aids and force the change of lead on
the straight line without diminishing the gait.</p>

<p>The above movements are very difficult to accomplish
smoothly and correctly. The change of aids must
not be accomplished roughly and the aids must be used
with only the intensity required to change the lead, thereby
not forcing the horse to increase of speed.</p>

<h2>PART III.</h2>

<h3>CHAPTER I.<br />
<span class="smcap">Jumping.</span></h3>

<p>Jumping is an exercise which when properly undertaken
is most instructive and productive of good results
to both man and horse.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Mechanism of the Jump for Height.</span></h4>

<p>(Jumping from the Gallop Left.)</p>

<p>1. As the left fore foot is about to leave the ground,
just before the moment of suspension of the gallop, the
leg, especially the fetlock joint, is straightened.</p>

<p>2. The head and neck are elevated.</p>

<p>The above movement raises the forehand.</p>

<p>3. Just as the left foot is raised the two hind legs
are brought up to a place on the ground about where the
left fore foot was.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span></p>

<p>4. The hind legs are straightened out.</p>

<p>Due to the last movement, the horse completely
leaves the ground and takes the obstacle, with fore and
hind legs bent.</p>

<p>5. The horse lands on the left fore foot, legs
straight.</p>

<p>6. The right fore foot, leg straight, is then brought
to the support.</p>

<p>7. The left fore foot is picked up.</p>

<p>8. The right fore foot is picked up and simultaneously
the left hind comes to the ground.</p>

<p>9. The right hind comes to the ground.</p>

<p>The horse then is galloping right after landing.</p>

<p>The horse leaps from a trot from one front leg and
both hind legs. The leap is more difficult, as it is impossible
at a trot to get both hind legs side by side up
under the body to “take off.”</p>

<p>From the walk and halt, the horse in jumping first
rears, then straightens out his hind legs.</p>

<p>As jumping for height at a gallop is the easiest for
a horse, and as the principles encountered apply equally<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
well to the other gaits, the following deductions are made
from the mechanism at the gallop, as explained in previous
paragraphs.</p>

<p>From Paragraph 1: As the distance from the jump
to the place where the left leg leaves the ground is of the
utmost importance to the horse, he should be allowed
to gauge his stride while approaching the jump.</p>

<p>From Paragraph 2: As the head and neck are
raised to assist in raising the fore quarters, the rider’s
body should not lean forward of the perpendicular, for
this would hinder the movement. As the horse’s object
is to lighten the fore quarters, it follows that great speed
is a detriment to a horse in jumping, for the more speed
the more weight upon the forehand. Raising the head
and neck necessitates lengthening the reins at the moment
of extension, or letting them slide through the fingers.
It follows then, that, as a false movement of the hand
with a severe bit causes greater injury than one with a
snaffle bit, a snaffle bit should be used in jumping until
proficiency is obtained.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span></p>

<p>From Paragraph 3: To facilitate the bringing well
up under the body of the hind leg, the rider’s legs must
be carried back.</p>

<p>From Paragraph 5: The weight of the rider’s body
must set to the rear to assist the horse by lightening the
load on the forehand while landing. If a severe bit or
a hard hand pulls the head in and bends the neck while
the horse is in this position, by cramping the muscles of
the neck the horse is prevented from stretching his legs
to the front to insure a safe landing.</p>

<p>From Paragraph 7: If the rider’s weight is forward
or he is thrown upon the horse’s neck while the horse is
landing, the extra weight on the forehand prevents the
fore leg being picked up and causes over-reaching. Extreme
speed has the same effect with the same result.</p>

<p>From Paragraphs 8 and 9: It is seen that the horse
is galloping with the other lead after landing. In jumping
in the riding-hall care should be exercised at the corner
beyond the jump if at the gallop, for, if galloping
correctly at the start, the horse is galloping false after
the jump.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Teaching the Horse to Jump.</i>—Place a bar upon the
ground and lead the horse over it at a walk. When the
horse executes this movement correctly, raise the bar to
about two feet and jump the horse upon the longe.</p>

<p><i>To Jump a Horse on the Longe.</i>—First instruct the
horse sufficiently upon the longe until he goes equally
well on either hand. Approach the jump, the horse circling
on the longe on the left hand, for instance. The
trainer holds the longe in the left hand so that it can be
allowed to run out with ease; the longeing-whip is held
in the right hand. Circle the horse near the jump until
the horse goes quietly. The circles are made slightly in
rear of the jump. When the horse is quiet, move so that
the jump will intercept the circle the horse is making.
As the horse approaches the jump the trainer, with the
longe fairly taut, likewise approaches the end of the bar
nearest him, keeping the longeing-whip held in rear of
the horse. Urge the horse with the whip, if necessary,
until he jumps. After taking off, let the longe run
through the fingers so as not to yank the horse or bring<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
him up short. When the horse does well, stop him and
caress him or give him carrots or oats.</p>

<p>Jumping should be begun at first at the walk, then
at the trot and gallop. The horse jumping for the first
time gauges his stride more easily at the walk.</p>

<p>A bar may be placed two or three feet from the
ground in the opening of the corral fence, etc., so that
the horses that have been worked at jumping on the
longe may be thus intercepted by an easy jump on their
way to the corral or to some such place to which they
are desirous of going. A man with a longeing-whip
stands ready to urge on any that refuse. This jump
should be stiff and helps to prepare horses for outdoor
jumping.</p>

<p><i>Riding the Horse Over the Jump.</i>—The horse being
able to jump with sufficient accuracy, on the longe, is
mounted. First, he is ridden over the bar on the ground,
then over the bar gradually raised to suit the horse.</p>

<p>On taking a horse up to the jump the following are
essential points to remember:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span></p>

<p>1. The rider must make up his mind that he is going
to make the horse jump.</p>

<p>2. He must have confidence in his balance and not
stiffen his muscles.</p>

<p>3. He must increase the grip with his knees and
the calves of his legs and keep his hands low.</p>

<p>4. The rider must have the horse well in hand and
must remember that if a horse attempts to slip out to
the left, the use of the right rein, to turn the head to the
right, helps the horse to go to the left by freeing the left
shoulder. The rein of support is the one which should
be used, together with whichever leg will straighten the
horse so that he is perpendicular to his jump.</p>

<p>Horses are more easily controlled in the riding-hall,
but jump with more freedom outdoors. Outdoor jumping
should be taken up as soon as the horse learns to
jump moderately well indoors.</p>

<p>Wings are not found in ’cross-country work, hence
a troop horse whose training is fitting him for just such
work should not be made dependent upon them by their
use in the riding-hall all the time.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Jumping for Breadth.</i>—This is a more difficult jump
to teach a new horse, because he is more fearful of a
ditch than of a fence. From the nature of the jump, it
can only be taught outdoors. The method of instruction
is the same as for jumping for height.</p>

<p>As the momentum acquired by speed is essential to
carry the horse’s body across an open ditch, greater speed
is necessary than in jumping for height. Excessive
speed, however, so weights down the forehand that it
becomes difficult for the horse to raise his forehand
sufficiently to clear the ditch.</p>

<hr />

<h2>CONCLUSION.</h2>

<p>Although all horses are different one from another,
the preceding rules generally apply. The rider who appreciates
the needs of his horse is the one most likely to
succeed in training.</p>

<p>To many, the expenditure of six months in training
troop horses by these methods seems unnecessary and
impracticable. With experienced men and amenable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
horses the time may be slightly reduced. A horse cannot
be hurried, and slipshod, careless training is often
worse than none.</p>

<p>As it has been found entirely practical to follow out
this course with enlisted men on remounts at a regimental
post, it is to be hoped that heavy, hard-gaited,
uncomfortable horses to ride will soon disappear from
the ranks.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
